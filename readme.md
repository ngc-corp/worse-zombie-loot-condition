# Worse Zombie Loot Condition - Project Zomboid Mod

Multiple holes are added to clothing when a zombie is hit, and additional damage is done to other items when a zombie dies.
This tries to make clothing stores and patching up holes (tailoring) more useful and rewarding since it is hard to get some of those brand new boots otherwise.
